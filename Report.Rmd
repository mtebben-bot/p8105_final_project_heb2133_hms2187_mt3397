# Final Report
This page contains the written report for our final project.

## Motivation
 Provide an overview of the project goals and motivation.
 
## Related Work
Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, or something we discussed in class.

## Initial Questions
What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

Our primary questions were: How does happiness vary across nations?
How does freedom vary across nations? 
Does freedom have an impact on happiness/do freedom and happiness have a positive association?

These questions evolved over the course of the project after we did initial mappings and exploratory analysis. Upon noticing certain high and low rankings, we wanted to further analyze the lowest and highest ranked countries, both for freedom and happiness. In addition, we wanted to see how different subtypes of freedom were connected to happiness, not just overall freedom.
