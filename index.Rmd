## Project Objective

Using data from the World Happiness Report (WHR) and Human Freedom Index (HFI), we set out to explore how citizens' perceived happiness connects to the degree of human freedom in their corresponding countries.

We begin by presenting a broad visual of how happiness and human freedom are distributed on a global scale, noting particularly high and low ranked countries. We use linear analysis to explore the relationship of human freedom and citizen happiness, including the impact of various subtypes of human freedom. Finally, we investigate the story of "Nordic exceptionalism" by offering a closer look at Nordic countries and how human freedoms may play a role in this narrative. 

Our process of cleaning and merging these datasets is outline in ....

## About our Data

### The World Happiness Report 

The WHR contains survey results from participants in 156 countries on their subjective wellbeing  - in other words, how happy citizens perceive themselves to be. It explores how citizen wellbeing connects to, and can be explained by, various other influencing factors – such as GDP, government, conflicts, and social support. The 2019 report utilizes data from the Gallup World Poll (years 2005 – 2018).

The report and corresponding data can be found at:

### The Human Freedom Index

The 2019 Human Freedom Index broadly measures the degree of human freedom in 162 countries using various indicators of social and economic freedom including, security, size of government, religion, and civil rights. It then ranks the included countries by their overall “human freedom score”.
